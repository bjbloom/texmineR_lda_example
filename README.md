## textmineR Example

This is a fairly simple repo. The intention is to simply demonstrate some of the functionality of the (`textmineR`)[https://github.com/TommyJones/textmineR] package in R. I have a few functions that differ from the `textmineR` vignette on topic modeling that help display the model diagnostics and transform the model output back into a data frame for analysis.
